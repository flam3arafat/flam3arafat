Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer located in Bangladesh.

I have a serious passion for UI effects, animations and creating intuitive, dynamic user experiences.

My main experience is in front-end development but I also have a passion for design.

Given that producing a modern website requires the combination of design, server technology, and the layer that users interacts with. 

I believe having experience in both design and development allows for making the most optimal user experiences.
